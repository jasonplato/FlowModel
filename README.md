# Flow Model

## Project Description
The vision of us is to lower the entrance of understanding token economy, by implementing a practical tool to design and measure token-economy model.  
The knowledge insight on top of the model can be minted as NFT along with model itself.  
We also provide a NFT marketplace for users to trade or check those NFTs as a way to spread and share valuable knowledge of token economy.
